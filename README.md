### Hello, World!

I'm attending the third year computer science at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie. Parallel to my graduation, I'm working at Ita√∫ Unibanco as a data analytics engineer intern. Below you will find some subjects which I'm very interested and my favorite tools/languages:
  - Data analytics engeneering, cloud computing and automation;
  - Stacks: C, C++, Python, SQL, SAS, Alteryx Designer, Tableau and Excel.
