### Hello ðŸŒŽ
I'm attending the third year computer science at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie. Parallel to my graduation, I'm working at ItaÃº Unibanco as an analytics engineer where I develop activities like data preparing and visualization, process automation and strategic reports to business teams. Below you will find some subjects which I'm very interested:
  - Data analytics, cloud computing and automation;
  - Stacks: C, C++, Python, SQL, SAS, Alteryx Designer, Tableau and Excel.
